1. Put service in feature\shared location as it will be used in various components of a feature
    e.g. library\shared\book-data.service.ts
2. Do use attribute directives when you have presentation logic without a template.
3. Consider preferring the @HostListener and @HostBinding to the host property of the @Directive and @Component decorators.
